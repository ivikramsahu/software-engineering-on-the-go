## Computer Science for Everyone

I have been in Software engineer for almost 6+ years now. Having hands-on experience on multiple programming languages, databases (SQL and NoSQL), servers, and few others that change over the period of time. So you can assume me  _**Jack of all trades but master of none**_. While I know about programming and how software can scale, there is always a common problem that every software engineer feels within that is **the imposter syndrome**.

I have been going throught the same feelings and while these one of the common things in tech always keep yourself motivate and keep learning new things. So, I have decided to create a roadmap for all those who feels just like me and have been going though same phase of their career.

I don't know how this repository will grow over the period of time but I will keep adding resources and my personal learing on how anyone can make their career in Software Engineering.

I recommend going through this amazing github reposistory by @jwasham : [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)

     <details close>
       <summary>What does a front-end developer do?</summary> 
       <br>
       Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.
       <br><br>
       If someone wanted to build a website, for example, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of the site or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.

- [Backend Developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
     <details close>
      <summary> who is a back-end developer?</summary>
      <br>
        A back-end developer is a type of programmer who creates the logical back-end and core computational logic of a website, software or information system. The developer creates components and features that are indirectly accessed by a user through a front-end application or system.
      </details>

      <summary>What does a back-end developer do?</summary>
      <br>
         A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.

      - RUNS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS
         <br><br>
         Companies today deploy websites and web applications in a range of environments. For starters, some businesses choose sites operating on database servers, and others install online apps in the cloud. Around the same period, more companies are now merging all hosting services to take advantage of advantages such as improved capacity and scalability.
         <br><br> 
         The setup of the Web server varies from network to network. The programmers also frequently distribute workload server-side over multiple machines. The varying hosting environments make customizing website backend essential for developers.
         <br><br>
      - MAKES INFORMATION SHARING FASTER
         <br><br>
         The backend consists of three critical elements of a website, i.e., application, web server, and database, as mentioned previously. Each user should be able to provide his/her login name and password while accessing a website’s user interface. The username ID and the user’s password is checked via the runtime. Similarly, any details that the user submits is processed in the backend application in the repositories. 
         <br><br> 
         The backend often retrieves data from the archive and transfers the details to the web interface for the app view. Hence, a website’s backend serves as its framework and enables the sharing of knowledge. 
         <br><br>
       - IMPACTS THE WEBSITE’S USER EXPERIENCE
         <br>
         A website’s accessibility and user interface will, over the long term, depend on its success. As noted earlier, the backend performs all tasks required to make a website function. And the consistency of backend technology can influence the user interface provided by a website. Any problems with the backend code can lead to frequent website crashes, slow running of the site, and similar performance issues.  
        <br><br>
         At the same time, small vulnerabilities in the backend code will render the website susceptible to targeted ransomware attacks and protection. Developers must concentrate on the consistency and layout of the backend code to ensure that the site offers a better user experience without interruption. 
         <br><br>
       - ADDS FUNCTIONALITY UTILITY TO EACH FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
         <br><br>
         When developing a website, programmers are required to write backend code to add utility to the functionality of each frontend. For example, to add functionality to a user login form, they must write code using a server-side programming language. The backend code collects the values each time a user enters his login credentials and compares them with the login data stored in databases. <br><br> Similarly, the backend code adds functionality to different forms, profiles, and accounts. Without quality backend technology, thus, no website will work.

- [DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops)
  <details close>
   <summary>Who is a devOps engineer></summary>
   <br>
      A DevOps engineer is an IT generalist who should have a wide-ranging knowledge of both development and operations, including coding, infrastructure management, system administration, and DevOps toolchains. DevOps engineers should also possess interpersonal skills since they work across company silos to create a more collaborative environment. 
      <br><br>
      DevOps engineers need to have a strong understanding of common system architecture, provisioning, and administration, but must also have experience with the traditional developer toolset and practices such as using source control, giving and receiving code reviews, writing unit tests, and familiarity with agile principles.

      <summary>What does an devOps engineer do?</summary>
      <br>
      - The role of a DevOps engineer will vary from one organization to another, but invariably entails some combination of release engineering, infrastructure provisioning and management, system administration, security, and DevOps advocacy. 
      <br><br>
      - Release engineering includes the work required to build and deploy application code. The exact tools and processes vary widely depending on many variables, such as what language the code is written in, how much of the pipeline has been automated, and whether the production infrastructure is on-premise or in the cloud. Release engineering might entail selecting, provisioning, and maintaining CI/CD tooling or writing and maintaining bespoke build/deploy scripts.
      <br><br>
      - Infrastructure provisioning and system administration include deploying and maintaining the servers, storage, and networking resources required to host applications. For organizations with on-premise resources this might include managing physical servers, storage devices, switches, and virtualization software in a data center. For a hybrid or entirely cloud-based organization this will usually include provisioning and managing virtual instances of the same components. 
      <br><br>
      - DevOps advocacy is often undervalued or overlooked entirely, but is arguably the most important role of a DevOps engineer. The shift to a DevOps culture can be disruptive and confusing to the engineering team members. As the DevOps subject matter expert, it falls to the DevOps engineer to help evangelize and educate the DevOps way across the organization.
